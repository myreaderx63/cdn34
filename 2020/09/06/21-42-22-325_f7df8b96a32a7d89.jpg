<p><strong>A sequel, and a corrective: In the first <em>Daily Rituals</em>, I featured far more men than women; in this second volume, I correct the imbalance with profiles of the day-to-day working lives of 143 women writers, artists, and performers, including:</strong></p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li>
<p>Octavia Butler, who wrote every day no matter what. “Screw inspiration,” she said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isak Dinesen, who subsisted on oysters and champagne but also amphetamines, which gave her the overdrive she required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The American sculptor Harriet Hosmer, who believed female artists should never marry and thus “waged an eternal feud with the consolidating knot.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Martha Graham, who eschewed socializing in favor of long hours alone in her studio: “Talk is a privilege and one must deny oneself that privilege.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lillian Hellman, who chain-smoked three packs of cigarettes and drank twenty cups of coffee a day (after milking the cow and cleaning the barn on her Hardscrabble Farm), and who carried projects forward on successive currents of “elation, depression, hope.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>. . . and 138 others on their daily routines, superstitions, fears, eating (and drinking) habits, and other finely—and not so finely— calibrated rituals.</p>

<p>I launched Daily Routines on a Sunday afternoon in July 2007, while procrastinating on a writing assignment due the following day. It was intended as a hobby, and for the first year and a half I had a readership of about a dozen friends, coworkers, and family members.</p>
<p>Then, in December 2008, <em>Slate</em> wrote a story about <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/lifehacking/2008/12/drinking_coffee_in_the_shower.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the quest for the perfect morning routine</a> that quoted liberally from my blog. Suddenly I went from having a record of five visitors in one day to almost 18,000, and more than 80,000 visitors for the month.</p>
<p>Along with all of these visitors came a steady stream of comments and e-mails—including a few e-mails from editors and literary agents suggesting that I turn the blog into a book. Two weeks after the <em>Slate</em> article came out, I signed on with one of those agents; over Christmas vacation, I wrote a book proposal. By April 2009, after lots of back-and-forth with several editors, I signed a contract with my dream publisher, Knopf.</p>
<p>Now, four years later, the Daily Routines book—officially titled&#0160;<em><a href="http://masoncurrey.com/daily-rituals/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Daily Rituals: How Artists Work</a></em>—is finally coming out. It presents the routines and working habits of 161 creative minds—among them, novelists, poets, playwrights, composers, painters, philosophers, and scientists. It is packed with anecdotes about getting up super early, staying up super late, drinking heroic amounts of coffee, taking precisely timed naps and long daily walks, and much more.</p>
<p>In other words, if you enjoyed the blog, I&#39;m confident that you&#39;ll like the book even better. It comes out April 23, and can now be pre-ordered from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Rituals-How-Artists-Work/dp/0307273601/?tag=dailrout20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/daily-rituals-mason-currey/1112313657" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>, <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/62-9780307273604-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Powell&#39;s</a>, or <a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780307273604" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IndieBound</a>.</p>

				<p>INTERVIEWER<br />People say that you have great self-discipline and that you never let a day go by without working. At what time do you start?</p><p>DE BEAUVOIR<br />I&#39;m always in a hurry to get going, though in general I dislike starting the day. I first have tea and then, at about ten o&#39;clock, I get under way and work until one. Then I see my friends and after that, at five o&#39;clock, I go back to work and continue until nine. I have no difficulty in picking up the thread in the afternoon. When you leave, I&#39;ll read the paper or perhaps go shopping. Most often it&#39;s a pleasure to work. </p><p>INTERVIEWER<br />When do you see Sartre?</p><p>
DE BEAUVOIR<br />Every evening and often at lunchtime. I generally work at his place in the afternoon.</p><p>INTERVIEWER<br />Doesn&#39;t it bother you to go from one apartment to another?</p><p>
DE BEAUVOIR<br />No. Since I don&#39;t write scholarly books, I take all my papers with me and it works out very well.</p><p>INTERVIEWER<br />Do you plunge in immediately?</p><p>
DE BEAUVOIR<br />It depends to some extent on what I&#39;m writing. If the work is going well, I spend a quarter or half an hour reading what I wrote the day before, and I make a few corrections. Then I continue from there. In order to pick up the thread I have to read what I&#39;ve done.</p><p>INTERVIEWER<br />Do your writer friends have the same habits as you?</p><p>
DE BEAUVOIR<br />No, it&#39;s quite a personal matter. Genet, for example, works quite differently. He puts in about twelve hours a day for six months when he&#39;s working on something and when he has finished he can let six months go by without doing anything. As I said, I work every day except for two or three months of vacation when I travel and generally don&#39;t work at all. I read very little during the year, and when I go away I take a big valise full of books, books that I don&#39;t have time to read. But if the trip lasts a month or six weeks, I do feel uncomfortable, particularly if I&#39;m between two books. I get bored if I don&#39;t work.</p><p><em><a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/viewinterview.php/prmMID/4444" target="_blank">The Paris Review</a></em>, Spring-Summer 1965</p><p>(<em>Thanks to Marcine Miller.</em>)</p>

				<p>Perhaps the finest writer ever to use speed systematically, however, was W. H. Auden. He swallowed Benzedrine every morning for twenty years, from 1938 onward, balancing its effect with the barbiturate Seconal when he wanted to sleep. (He also kept a glass of vodka by the bed, to swig if he woke up during the night.) He took a pragmatic attitude toward amphetamines, regarding them as a &quot;labor-saving device&quot; in the &quot;mental kitchen,&quot; with the important proviso that &quot;these mechanisms are very crude, liable to injure the cook, and constantly breaking down.&quot;</p><p>

				<p><em>How do you begin writing?</em><br />
Fitfully. I&#39;ll write something, but it won&#39;t be the beginning or the middle or the end -- I&#39;m just getting an idea out on the page. Then, as the words accumulate, I start thinking about how they need to be organized.</p><p>

<em>What is in front of you when you begin to write?</em><br />
Nothing, except for the computer screen. I write from memory, as if I were writing a novel. When I finish a day&#39;s writing I go back and check the text against my notes to make sure the facts and quotes are right, and that I haven&#39;t inadvertently made anything up. The quotes are almost always accurate because by that point I&#39;ve gone over the material so many times in my head.</p><p>

<em>Is there any time of day you like to write?</em><br />
I&#39;ve always written best very early in the morning and very late at night. I write very little in the middle of the day. If I do any work in the middle of the day, it is editing what I&#39;ve written that morning.</p><p>

<em>What would your ideal writing day look like?</em><br />
Left to my own devices, with no family, I&#39;d start writing at seven p.m. and stop at four a.m. That is the way I used to write. I liked to get ahead of everybody. I&#39;d think to myself, &quot;I&#39;m starting tomorrow&#39;s workday, tonight!&quot; Late nights are wonderfully tranquil. No phone calls, no interruptions. I like the feeling of knowing that nobody is trying to reach me.</p><p>

<em>Is there anywhere you need to be in order to write?</em><br />
No, I&#39;ve written in every conceivable circumstance. I like writing in my office, which is an old redwood cabin about a hundred yards from my house in Berkeley. It has a kitchen, a little bedroom, a bathroom, and a living room, which I use as as study. But I&#39;ve written in awful enough situations that I know that the quality of the prose doesn&#39;t depend on the circumstance in which it is composed. I don&#39;t believe the muse visits you. I believe that you visit the muse. If you wait for that &quot;perfect moment&quot; you&#39;re not going to be very productive.</p><p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>JONATHAN LETHEM: What were you doing today before I appeared in your house?</p><p>

PAUL AUSTER: The usual. I got up in the morning. I read the paper. I drank a pot of tea. And then I went over to the little apartment I have in the neighborhood and worked for about six hours. After that, I had to do some business. My mother died two years ago, and there was one last thing to take care of concerning her estate—a kind of insurance bond I had to sign off on. So, I went to a notary public to have the papers stamped, then mailed them to the lawyer. I came back home. I read my daughter’s final report card. And then I went upstairs and paid a lot of bills. A typical day, I suppose. A mix of working on the book and dealing with a lot of boring, practical stuff.</p><p>

JL: For me, five or six hours of writing is plenty. That’s a lot. So, if I get that many hours the other stuff feels satisfying. The other stuff feels like a kind of grace. But if I have to do that stuff when I haven’t written—</p><p>

PA: Oh, that’s terrible.</p><p>

JL: That’s a terrible thing.</p><p>

PA: I’ve found that writing novels is an all-absorbing experience—both physical and mental—and I have to do it every day in order to keep the rhythm, to keep myself focused on what I’m doing. Even Sunday, if possible. If there’s no family thing happening that day, I’ll at least work in the morning. Whenever I travel, I get thrown off completely. If I’m gone for two weeks, it takes me a good week to get back into the rhythm of what I was doing before.</p><p>

JL: I like the word “physical.” I have the same fetish for continuity. I don’t really ask of myself a given word or page count or number of hours. To work every day, that’s my only fetish. And there is a physical quality to it when a novel is thriving. It has an athletic component. You’re keeping a streak going.</p><p>

PA: Writing is physical for me. I always have the sense that the words are coming out of my body, not just my mind. I write in longhand, and the pen is scratching the words onto the page. I can even hear the words being written. So much of the effort that goes into writing prose for me is about making sentences that capture the music that I’m hearing in my head. It takes a lot of work, writing, writing, and rewriting to get the music exactly the way you want it to be. That music is a physical force. Not only do you write books physically, but you read books physically as well. There’s something about the rhythms of language that correspond to the rhythms of our own bodies. An attentive reader is finding meanings in the book that can’t be articulated, finding them in his or her body. I think this is what so many people don’t understand about fiction. Poetry is supposed to be musical. But people don’t understand prose. They’re so used to reading journalism—clunky, functional sentences that convey factual information—facts, more than just the surfaces of things.</p><p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="https://dailyroutines.typepad.com/daily_routines/2009/02/robert-caro.html">Robert Caro</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>By training, Robert Caro is a journalist. By profession, he is a biographer, among the most highly acclaimed living, thanks to his four books—three volumes on [Lyndon] Johnson and a saga about the New York public-works titan Robert Moses. But in his daily life, Caro more resembles a scientist, driven by the principle that you understand something only by observing it, watching it with great concentration and for a long time. In his New York City office, where everything has its particular place, he works long hours, seven days a week, poring through interview transcripts and primary source notes, working slowly and deliberately on books he publishes, on average, once every 10 years. His meticulous routine is sometimes painful, he says, but necessary. Only by gathering as many facts as possible, cataloging them, cross-checking them and sitting with them at great length, can he choose the right words to re-create the past inside his readers' heads. Words matter to Caro. "I have always thought," he told me this winter, "that in nonfiction, the level of the writing has to be as good as any novel if it is going to endure." [...]</p><p>

"This building used to be filled with writers," Caro says as he lets a visitor into his Manhattan office, two blocks south of Central Park. "They're all gone now. Now it's just me."</p><p>

Caro receives his own guests here. He has no secretary or bright young assistant to fetch coffee or comb through files. The only person he really trusts with his work is Ina [his wife]; she keeps her own office further uptown. He does not use a computer. He does have a telephone, but its chief virtue, Caro says, is that it "can be turned off." There are seldom knocks on the door. Still, Caro wears a coat and tie to the office each morning so he never forgets when he sits down with his research that he is going to work.</p><p>

Every inch of the New York office is governed by rules. There are regulations for book placement (general nonfiction on the post–Cold War is farthest from Caro's desk; books on his immediate subject are kept closest) and the stacking of notebooks (new interview subjects, like the JFK speechwriter Theodore Sorensen, sit at the top of the heap, while the oldest interviews, like Johnson's brother, Sam Houston, inhabit the bottom). The western wall contains only a giant outline—20 pages that get Caro from the beginning to the end of each book. "I trained myself to be organized," he explains, pointing almost apologetically at his massive writer's map. "If you're fumbling around trying to remember what notebook has what quote, you can't be in the room with the people you're writing about."</p><p>

Even Caro's home is governed by a code he created to keep himself productive and sane. The Caros' Upper West Side apartment is filled with books, his collection and hers, but none sit in the dining or living rooms. "When he's at home, he doesn't want to think about his work," Ina explains. Indeed, though they have each devoted their lives to him for more than three decades, the Caros have a policy of not discussing Lyndon Johnson, at dinner or anywhere else. Ina presents her research to Bob in typed reports, which her husband then marks up. "I know what he's looking for without him telling me," she explains. She rarely reads his work until it is in manuscript form.</p><p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Despite all this activity Churchill’s daily routine changed little during these years. He awoke about 7:30 a.m. and remained in bed for a substantial breakfast and reading of mail and all the national newspapers. For the next couple of hours, still in bed, he worked, dictating to his secretaries.</p><p>

At 11:00 a.m., he arose, bathed, and perhaps took a walk around the garden, and took a weak whisky and soda to his study.</p><p>

At 1:00 p.m. he joined guests and family for a three-course lunch. Clementine drank claret, Winston champagne, preferable Pol Roger served at a specific temperature, port brandy and cigars. When lunch ended, about 3:30 p.m. he returned to his study to work, or supervised work on his estate, or played cards or backgammon with Clementine.</p><p>

At 5:00 p.m., after another weak whisky and soda, he went to be for an hour and a half. He said this siesta, a habit gained in Cuba, allowed him to work 1 1/2 days in every 24 hours. At 6:30 p.m. he awoke, bathed again, and dressed for dinner at 8:00 p.m.</p><p>

Dinner was the focal-point and highlight of Churchill’s day. Table talk, dominated by Churchill, was as important as the meal. Sometimes, depending on the company, drinks and cigars extended the event well past midnight. The guests retired, Churchill returned to his study for another hour or so of work.</p><p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Although his presidency is barely a week old, some of Mr. Obama’s work habits are already becoming clear. He shows up at the Oval Office shortly before 9 in the morning, roughly two hours later than his early-to-bed, early-to-rise predecessor. Mr. Obama likes to have his workout — weights and cardio — first thing in the morning, at 6:45. (Mr. Bush slipped away to exercise midday.)</p>
<p>He reads several papers, eats breakfast with his family and helps pack his daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, off to school before making the 30-second commute downstairs — a definite perk for a man trying to balance work and family life. He eats dinner with his family, then often returns to work; aides have seen him in the Oval Office as late as 10 p.m., reading briefing papers for the next day.</p>
<p>“Even as he is sober about these challenges, I have never seen him happier,” Mr. Axelrod said. “The chance to be under the same roof with his kids, essentially to live over the store, to be able to see them whenever he wants, to wake up with them, have breakfast and dinner with them — that has made him a very happy man.”</p>

				<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">“There are certain things I do if I sit down to write,” he said. “I have a glass of water or a cup of tea. There’s a certain time I sit down, from 8:00 to 8:30, somewhere within that half hour every morning,” he explained. “I have my vitamin pill and my music, sit in the same seat, and the papers are all arranged in the same places. The cumulative purpose of doing these things the same way every day seems to be a way of saying to the mind, you’re going to be dreaming soon.</span></p><p style="font-family: Arial;">

“It’s not any different than a bedtime routine,” he continued. “Do you go to bed a different way every night? Is there a certain side you sleep on? I mean I brush my teeth, I wash my hands. Why would anybody wash their hands before they go to bed? I don’t know. And the pillows are supposed to be pointed a certain way. The open side of the pillowcase is supposed to be pointed in toward the other side of the bed. I don’t know why.”</p><p style="font-family: Arial;"></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">

First drafts as early in the morning as possible, then second, then third (retyping, I work on a manual). Once the first draft is 80% completed I start on the second, so that there&#39;s a conveyor belt of drafts in progress: this helps me to grasp the totality of the book.

Rituals. Smoking--pipes, cigars, special brands, accessories, the whole bollocks. Coffee, tea, strange infusions--I have a stove on my desk. Fetishising typewriters, pens, etc. Overall, though, I have a healthy appetite for solitude. If you don&#39;t, you have no business being a writer.</p><p style="font-family: Arial;">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">We now settled into a routine which has ever since served in my mind as an archetype, so that what I still mean when I speak of a &quot;normal&quot; day (and lament that normal days are so rare) is a day of the Bookham pattern. For if I could please myself I would always live as I lived there. I would choose always to breakfast at exactly eight and to be at my desk by nine, there to read or write till one. If a cup of good tea or coffee could be brought me about eleven, so much the better. A step or so out of doors for a pint of beer would not do quite so well; for a man does not want to drink alone and if you meet a friend in the taproom the break is likely to be extended beyond its ten minutes. At one precisely lunch should be on the table; and by two at the latest I would be on the road. Not, except at rare intervals, with a friend. Walking and talking are two very great pleasures, but it is a mistake to combine them. Our own noise blots out the sounds and silences of the outdoor world; and talking leads almost inevitably to smoking, and then farewell to nature as far as one of our senses is concerned. The only friend to walk with is one (such as I found, during the holidays, in Arthur) who so exactly shares your taste for each mood of the countryside that a glance, a halt, or at most a nudge, is enough to assure us that the pleasure is shared. The return from the walk, and the arrival of tea, should be exactly coincident, and not later than a quarter past four. Tea should be taken in solitude, as I took it as Bookham on those (happily numerous) occasions when Mrs. Kirkpatrick was out; the Knock himself disdained this meal. For eating and reading are two pleasures that combine admirably. Of course not all books are suitable for mealtime reading. It would be a kind of blasphemy to read poetry at table. What one wants is a gossipy, formless book which can be opened anywhere. The ones I learned so to use at Bookham were Boswell, and a translation of Herodotus, and Lang&#39;s </span><em style="font-family: Arial;">History of English Literature</em><span style="font-family: Arial;">. </span><em style="font-family: Arial;">Tristram Shandy</em><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><em style="font-family: Arial;">Elia</em><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and the </span><em style="font-family: Arial;">Anatomy of Melancholy</em><span style="font-family: Arial;"> are all good for the same purpose. At five a man should be at work again, and at it till seven. Then, at the evening meal and after, comes the time for talk, or, failing that, for lighter reading; and unless you are making a night of it with your cronies (and at Bookham I had none) there is no reason why you should ever be in bed later than eleven. But when is a man to write his letters? You forget that I am describing the happy life I led with Kirk or the ideal life I would live now if I could. And it is essential of the happy life that a man would have almost no mail and never dread the postman&#39;s knock.</span></p><p style="font-family: Arial;">

				<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">When he first started writing, Grisham says, he had &quot;these little rituals that were silly and brutal but very important.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">

&quot;The alarm clock would go off at 5, and I&#39;d jump in the shower. My office was 5 minutes away. And I had to be at my desk, at my office, with the first cup of coffee, a legal pad and write the first word at 5:30, five days a week.&quot;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">

His goal: to write a page every day. Sometimes that would take 10 minutes, sometimes an hour; ofttimes he would write for two hours before he had to turn to his job as a lawyer, which he never especially enjoyed. In the Mississippi Legislature, there were &quot;enormous amounts of wasted time&quot; that would give him the opportunity to write.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">

&quot;So I was very disciplined about it,&quot; he says, then quickly concedes he doesn&#39;t have such discipline now: &quot;I don&#39;t have to.&quot;</span></p><p><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2008/02/05/entertainment/e113116S10.DTL" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">San Francisco Chronicle</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Arial;">, Feb. 5, 2008</span></p><p><span style="font-family: Arial;">(<em>Thanks to Brenton Priestley</em>.)<br /></span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nearly every morning of his life, Mister Rogers has gone swimming, and now, here he is, standing in a locker room, seventy years old and as white as the Easter Bunny, rimed with frost wherever he has hair, gnawed pink in the spots where his dry skin has gone to flaking, slightly wattled at the neck, slightly stooped at the shoulder, slightly sunken in the chest, slightly curvy at the hips, slightly pigeoned at the toes, slightly aswing at the fine bobbing nest of himself... and yet when he speaks, it is in that voice, his voice, the famous one, the unmistakable one, the televised one, the voice dressed in sweater and sneakers, the soft one, the reassuring one, the curious and expository one, the sly voice that sounds adult to the ears of children and childish to the ears of adults, and what he says, in the midst of all his bobbing-nudity, is as understated as it is obvious: &quot;Well, Tom, I guess you&#39;ve already gotten a deeper glimpse into my daily routine than most people have.&quot;</span></p><p style="font-family: Arial;">

ONCE UPON A TIME, a long time ago, a man took off his jacket and put on a sweater. Then he took off his shoes and put on a pair of sneakers. His name was Fred Rogers. He was starting a television program, aimed at children, called Mister Rogers&#39; Neighborhood. He had been on television before, but only as the voices and movements of puppets, on a program called The Children&#39;s Corner. Now he was stepping in front of the camera as Mister Rogers, and he wanted to do things right, and whatever he did right, he wanted to repeat. And so, once upon a time, Fred Rogers took off his jacket and put on a sweater his mother had made him, a cardigan with a zipper. Then he took off his shoes and put on a pair of navy-blue canvas boating sneakers. He did the same thing the next day, and then the next... until he had done the same things, those things, 865 times, at the beginning of 865 television programs, over a span of thirty-one years. The first time I met Mister Rogers, he told me a story of how deeply his simple gestures had been felt, and received. He had just come back from visiting Koko, the gorilla who has learned--or who has been taught--American Sign Language. Koko watches television. Koko watches Mister Rogers&#39; Neighborhood, and when Mister Rogers, in his sweater and sneakers, entered the place where she lives, Koko immediately folded him in her long, black arms, as though he were a child, and then... &quot;She took my shoes off, Tom,&quot; Mister Rogers said.</p><p style="font-family: Arial;">

Koko was much bigger than Mister Rogers. She weighed 280 pounds, and Mister Rogers weighed 143. Koko weighed 280 pounds because she is a gorilla, and Mister Rogers weighed 143 pounds because he has weighed 143 pounds as long as he has been Mister Rogers, because once upon a time, around thirty-one years ago, Mister Rogers stepped on a scale, and the scale told him that Mister Rogers weighs 143 pounds. No, not that he weighed 143 pounds, but that he weighs 143 pounds.... And so, every day, Mister Rogers refuses to do anything that would make his weight change--he neither drinks, nor smokes, nor eats flesh of any kind, nor goes to bed late at night, nor sleeps late in the morning, nor even watches television--and every morning, when he swims, he steps on a scale in his bathing suit and his bathing cap and his goggles, and the scale tells him he weighs 143 pounds. This has happened so many times that Mister Rogers has come to see that number as a gift, as a destiny fulfilled, because, as he says, &quot;the number 143 means `I love you.&#39; It takes one letter to say &#39;I&#39; and four letters to say `love&#39; and three letters to say `you.&#39; One hundred and forty-three. `I love you.&#39; Isn&#39;t that wonderful?&quot;</p><p style="font-family: Arial;">

THE FIRST TIME I CALLED MISTER ROGERS on the telephone, I woke him up from his nap. He takes a nap every day in the late afternoon--just as he wakes up every morning at five-thirty to read and study and write and pray for the legions who have requested his prayers; just as he goes to bed at nine-thirty at night and sleeps eight hours without interruption.</p><p style="font-family: Arial;">
